# Mucho's eTindahan 🛒

**Mucho's eTindahan** is the digital extension of our physical sari-sari store — making it easier for nearby customers to browse and order everyday essentials online, right from their phones or laptops.

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a lightweight, mobile-friendly online sari-sari store where customers can:

- Browse available products

All orders will be processed via **Firebase**, allowing real-time data capture and basic backend functionality — no complicated logins or accounts needed.
